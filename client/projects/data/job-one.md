Non-profit organization [FACTNet](http://www.factnetglobal.org/) created the _Job One for Humanity_ initiative as a way to raise climate change awareness and gather support for further efforts to combat global warming. The antiquated design of their website did not do well to represent the importance of the organization's mission.

The website was created with [NationBuilder](http://nationbuilder.com), a CMS and associated service with a focus on community & crowdsourcing features. While functional, the platform was at this point struggling in the user experience department. Their selection of themes reflected this shortcoming.

Being a non-profit, the budget was tight for this project. In order to maximize the value of my work, I built off the stock theme as much as possible rather than create entirely new components. Additionally, we moved quickly through the design phase, the client approving the first mockup & branding proposal.

One goal of the redesign was to increase conversions â€” specifically, the collection of email addresses and digital signatures on a petition. The organization was preparing for a large fundraising drive combined with an advertising campaign. The website needed to be ready to make use of the increased traffic.

I had helped design a new logo as part of some previous work. The colors in this logo influenced color choice for the redesign, as the client was already comfortable with them. Other design decisions were focused on making the site visually sparser and giving the content more attention, including directing the user to key action points.

Work on _Job One_ required that I jump into an unfamiliar platform and codebase. Fortunately, I had been doing some smaller updates on the website up to this point, so when the client requested a full redesign I had enough information to give estimates.

In addition to becoming familiar with the theme structure, stylesheets, and [Liquid templating language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/), another hurdle I faced was the inability edit the site's JavaScript, an imposed limitation of the platform. I circumvented this by using more creative styling and limiting interactive functionality.

A major change involved converting the short, one-line footer to a large call-to-action section including an email input. This would be present on every page. In part due to these changes, the number of conversions increased by more than <span class="num">150%</span>.

At the time of writing, the website continues to serve as the face of the _Job One for Humanity_ initiative. I occasionally consult on technical issues.
