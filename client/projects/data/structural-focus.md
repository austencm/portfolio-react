An independent designer colleague I've had the pleasure of working with on occasion came to me with a contract for an architectural firm's new website. The design was clean, media-rich, and the client required substantial editing capability — right up my alley.

## Customization

The project focused heavily on solid editing capabilities for the client. With this in mind, WordPress was an easy choice for a CMS — its flexibility allowed me to create new data types and clear associated UI that would give the client control over <span class="num">100</span>% of the website's content, without needing to touch code.

## Portfolio

Structural Focus shines with its [portfolio]({{domain}}/portfolio/). Filled edge-to-edge with stunning photography, it was particularly satisfying to bring to life.

Instead of forcing the user to navigate back and forth between project details and the index, I wrote a script that would load individual project content into an overlay. Scripting also helped achieve the uneven, repeatable image grid.

Additionally, the Selected Projects section featured custom filter UI. The excellent [Isotope](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/) library provided functionality.
